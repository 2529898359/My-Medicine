# Introduction---my medicine
Medicine, doctor, patient... these are the words that I have never thought of until my senior year in high school. While living in this crazily fast paced country, I didn't really decide what career I would pursue in high school. I was simply living in the present moment all the time. Three meals a day, go to school, finish homework, have fun, these are the objectives that I had every single day, nothing more. However, things gradually became colorful during my Junior year when I established a very good relationship with my Math teacher---Mr. Wong. Ultimately, rur relationship evolved and reaached the level where he is like a family member to me. By studying under his excellent mentorship, I gradually fell in love with Math, which later got me in to astronamy. I love to learn about black holes, dark matters, the dark energy that feuled black whole, the logic that time can slows down as speed increases, and how our universe is created. At one point, I became so excited of learning conceptual science knowledge that I wanted to become an astronamer or a theoritical physicist and work for NASA. However, as my passion of my science interests grew, I realized that there were something missing in the potential jobs that I would be getting if I continued pursing my interests, and that is my desire to help others. About two years ago when I prepared SAT exam in China, I told my grandpa that I want to become a person who is meaningful to our soceity by helping others. I longed to become someone who can make a postive impact on this world, but it has to be expressed through my good ethics and selflessness. One special characterisctcs that I found in myself is my ability to emphasize with others. I don't know if this is a good ability or just a normal aspect of human nature, but everytime when I hear a sad story that happens to the people around me, there is a tremendeous emotion grow inside me. It growls in my chest and it wants to break free and escape from my body through my throat. To me, this is my strength. My strong emotional response propels me to help others and make them become happy again. Most importantly, I found it is extemely rewarding when the person who is initially in misery and eventually is able to smile again because they recieved the help from me. I have no idea why but whenever I contribute to someone's happiness, I become satisfied and happy too! I feel accomplished and hornored for being able to play an influencial role in other people's lives. Whenever a person is in his/her most vulnerable time, I want to do the best I can to help them and alliveate their pain. As a result, after making all these discoveries about myself, I decided to explore careers in healthcare. I feel that being a healthcare professional, I am able to fulfill my desires to pursue science knowledge while putting my emotional strength in good use. When doing research on healthcare professions, I realized that being a doctor is a  career that matches most of my expectations and needs of what I want to do in the future. Doctors not only have to learn the complex science of physiology, but they also helps others in their most vulnerable time. Yes, this over simplified job description of being a doctor almost 100% corresponds to what I said earlier about what I'm looking for when deciding for a career. Nevertheless, being a doctor is rewarding and might be a perfect fit for me, but becoming a doctor is a completely different story. out of 2000 undergraduates who are pre-med at the beginning in freshman year, only 200 of them presist till the end and apply for medical school, and only 40%(80 applicants) of the applicants will get accepted while the rest 60%(120 applicants) will get rejected. Despite the level of difficulty to become a doctor, maintain a healthy and enjoyable life style is another challenge. Indeed, the road to become a doctor is tough, very tough, and even right now as a pre-med undergrad, I don't even know if I can make into med school and get the career that I longed for. In the rest of these articles, I will list out my understanding of medicine, my fears, my strengths, my weaknesses, my inspirations, my determination, and try to decide if medicine is really a right choice for me along the way(6/20/19).


# Fields of medicine that I am interested: Primary care (internal medicine), cardiology, neurology
Primary care physician
  
  Job highlight: PCP provide first contact medical care to the patients. They are the ones that exam patients' synptoms fist and determine the potential causes, origins, effects of future healtha, and treatment. PCP's does not perform operations, but they have the responsibility to referal patients to the doctors that specialize in other fields based on their opinions on patients' wellbeings. In addition, PCP provides yearly exams to healthy family. This part of the duty highlights the disease prevention aspect of PCP.
  
  Disease that PCP treats: PCP treats everything, mostly diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, headaches, and abdominal pain. It is important to note that many of these diseases are more prevention focused rather than providing treatment. Also, helping to reduce patients stress and improve their mental healths is another aspect of PCP. 
  
  Benefits for being a PCP: I like the fact that PCP literally treat everything. They get to know all the physiology of human body and learn the mechanism of individual body structures as a whole. It is interesting if PCP connects all the knowledge they learn when treating the patients. Moreover, PCP have a really good work-life balance. Unlike other doctors who don't have regular working hours and sometimes might be call back to emergency room, PCP have fixed working schedules, and they usually don't work for so long time(less than 12hrs). Another benefits of being a PCP is that they are the very few type of doctors who has a lot of patient interaction as part of their job. I prefer more to communicate with patients than operating surgery. 
  
  Disadvantages of being a PCP: PCP know a lot of physiology but they don't go in depth. They are only required to have enough knowledge to give the first care to the patients. In other words, the knowledge that PCP have are very broad but shallow at the same time. This disadvantage sometimes evoke PCP's interest in specializing one area and become a spcialist, thus resulting PCP shortage. Another disadvantage is that many doctors might want to have both operation and patients interaction as part of their job. Many might want to do surgery to the patients. 
  
  Job outlook: estimate to have 15% job growth in the next 20 years.
  
  My preference: PCP is my first choice so far. I want to become a D.O and become a PCP in a rural area.

Cardiologist
  
  Job highlights: Cardiology is a branch of internal medicine, which similar to PCP because they all focuse on examing the symptom, giving treatment if needed, refer to a cardiac surgeon is needed, and help patients to prevent cardiovascular diseases. One unique part of a cardiologist is that they are able to perform  precedures like heart catheterization. Although this is not considered a surgery, it still requires hand-on skills. Another big part of a cardiologist is that they are responsibile for giving healthy diet routine for the patients. FYI, cardiologist is like a personal doctor for the patients. Despite they might refer the patient to a surgeon, they are the one that keep track with patients condition and get back to them after the surgery is done.
 
  Disease that cardiologist treats: primarily all heart diseases. There are branches inside cardiology such as pedeiatric cardiology, adult cardiology, or interventional cardiology. Some common diseases that cardiologists treat are Congenital heart disease, Arrhythmia, Coronary artery disease, Dilated cardiomyopathy, Myocardial infarction, Heart failure, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Mitral regurgitation, and Mitral valve prolapse.
  
  Pros of being a cardiologist: a lot of patients interactions. It is a good specialty for doctors who dislike surgery and prefer more in disease diagonsis and prevention. Also, like I said before cardiologist perform precedures to the patients, and this is a highlight where PCP lacks. Cardiologist has to learn how to do exam, how to read images and diagrams. Overall, there are a lot of varieties in what cardiologists do as their job.
  
  Cons of being a cardiologist: Cardiologist might be on call all to the ER most of the time since there are a lot of patients who come to the ER with a heart attack. The working hours might be long too. 
  
  
  Neurologist:

Job Highlights: Neurologists look after patients who have diseases or damage in nervous system. There are two nervous system---central and peripheral. Central nervous system includes brain and spinal cords whereas peripheral nervious system are sensory nerves that are brunched off from spine. Two nervous systems work together to recieve signals from the outside world and deliver new messages to the brain which then can make decision. Neurologists don't do surgery, and if surgery is needed, patients will be referred to a neuro surgeon. Nevertheless, neurologists diagonse patient's synptoms and follow up with treatments. When the cases are complicated, neurologists will perform diagnostic tests, such as EEG, CT scan, MRI, etc, to the patients. In addition, neurologists will focus on a specific fields in neurology. Some popular fields are stroke, seizure, movement disorders, or interventional neurology.

Diseases that neurologist treat: movement disorder like Parkinson's disease(Older people are more likely to develop this disorder. The synmptoms include tremours, werid facial expression,inability to write, etc. The cause of the disease is unknown but the mechanism of Parkinson's disease is that the brain lost the function to produce dopamine, which is a chemical substance that regulates our emotions and body movement. Lack of dopamine will lead to the symptom of Parkinson's disease. Despite the cause is unknown, we know that maintain a happy and healthy life style is beneficial to patients. Some complications are thinking difficulties, depression changes, bladder problem, and eating problem. Parkinson's diseases cannot be cured but can be improved with treatment), cerebrovascular disease, such as stroke(a condition where the brain cannot receive sufficient blood and oxygen. There are two type of strokes: Ischemic stroke and Hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic includes thrombotic stoke, which is the blood clot or plaque that formed else where in the body travels into the brain arteries and blocks the vessel, and Embolic stroke, which is the plaque that is formed in the local brain vessel area which will form blood clot when it raptures. In some cases, watershed stroke can occure when there are plaques form in the neck region arteries which then decrease the blood delivery to the brain. On the other hand, hemorrhagic stroke can be caused by high blood pressure which forms aneurysm or a berry shaped collection of blood. When it raptures, it leaks blood into the brain which results a lack of blood in the rest of the brain and a high pressure inside the skull. Another cause is when the connecting point between arteries and veins raptures due to high blood pressure), degenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease(which is the neurons in the brain lose connection with each other due to the formation of plaque and tau. When the different brain regions lose their connections, the brain shrinks and lead to the symptoms and complication like thinking and reasoning difficulties, memory loss, and dimentia. The causes are unknown but treatment can help.), and sezuires like epilepsy(a condition that occurs when the brain suddenly disconnects and stops working or experiences abnormal brain cell activities. During this period, the patients will experience mild symptoms like confusion or severe symptoms like sezuires or loss of consciousness. Most patients who have epilepsy are young adults and children. Generally, children who has epilepsy will outgrow the symptoms as they grow older. The complication of epilepsy can be life thretening if the patients are driving a vehicle or doing other consciousness required activities. The condition can not be cured but treatment can help).

Pros of being a neulogist: Neurology is a very broad field. There are always more things to learn since there are so many coniditions that are unknown for their causes. It is interesting to learn not only the brains but also other nerveous system like spines and sensory neurons. Another fastinating thing about neurology is that some conditions like stroke is related to the complication of other fields such as high blood pressure. I like how neurology is so complex and so related to other fields in medicine.

Cons of being a neulogist: a lot of stuff to learn and sometimes can be frustrating. Since for now there aren't so manby cures for diseases like epilepsy, it is hard to watch your patients to suffer from these conditions. Because neurology is so complex, there are a greater chance for the neulogist to make mistakes or unable to accurately diagnosis symptoms and provide effective treatment. Neulogist might also be on call all the time since brain injury is very common for ER patients.
